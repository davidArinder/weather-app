# A Simple Weather App

This is a simple weather app that shows weather information at the user's current location both for the current day and a five-day, three-hourly forecast.

## To Run the App

Clone the codebase, install, and use `yarn start`. Before it will work, though, you'll need to get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) by signing up for an account. Then create a .env file in the root of the app and add `REACT_APP_API_KEY=` and append your API key with no spaces or quotations.
